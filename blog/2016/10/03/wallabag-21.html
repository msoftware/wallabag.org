OK, you can import thousand of articles, but your web server can&#39;t process so much data: you&#39;ll most probably end up with a timeout error if you try to import too many articles. This problem exists in wallabag for years. That&#39;s why we worked on a system to fetch content and import articles into wallabag asynchronously: you ask wallabag to import your articles, wallabag saves all the URLs of these articles and then, a queue system fetches content while you&#39;re using wallabag. In order to use this feature, wallabag needs Redis or RabbitMQ. The wallabag documentation explains how to configure these services. Beware : these services will certainly not be available if you use shared hosting. Feature developed by j0k3r and nicosomb in #1941 You can finally manage your users You can now easily create, delete or edit an account in your wallabag instance.As an administrator of wallabag, you&#39;ll have a new interface, available in the menu: Users management. Feature developed by j0k3r in #2327 You like an article? Share it with your friends! This feature was claimed for months (on 2 August, 2013!). You can now share an article publicly: by clicking on the share menu in the sidebar of the article, you can generate a public link and share it on your favorite social network!Like inside your wallabag, the article is displayed in a comfortable view. Feature developed by nicosomb in #1904 One more thing... Dmitriy Bogdanov (@di72nn) worked really hard on the Android app and came out with the following new features : A background service It handles offline actions, like saving an article offline, marking an article as read, favoriting it or deleting it. These actions are then executed when it&#39;s possible. Automatic sync You can sync local changes and download eventual new articles on a defined schedule. Local changes can also be synched as soon as the network is available. Finally, it&#39;s possible to download an article you just added. A new connection wizard It helps you connecting to your wallabag instance. Just choose your instance or define its address, put it your credentials, and the wizard will automatically fetch connection informations. Notifications ! You get notifications when the app is syncing, and when an error occurs. A proper preferences screen We got rid of the old ugly screen. Every option is saved when you change it.

<h2>Import from ...</h2>
<p>The recent news (<a href="http://blog.instapaper.com/post/149374303661">Instapaper is joining Pinterest</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@readability/the-readability-bookmarking-service-will-shut-down-on-september-30-2016-1641cc18e02b#.jzcn686qt">The Readability bookmarking service will shut down on September 30, 2016</a>) in the read-it-later ecosystem encouraged us to change our roadmap. We planned to work on the Tags feature for this 2.1 version but we worked hard on importing your data from 3rd-party services (but we've also made a few changes on the tags feature !).</p>

    <h3>... Readability</h3>
    <p>At the end of August, Readability announced that its general public service will shut down on September 30. One day after this announce, j0k3r developed a Readability import. It's easy to use, you just need to select your Readability export on your computer and import it.</p>

    <p>In your favorite browser, you can save bookmarks, thousands of bookmarks. Now, you can also import them into wallabag. It's a just a file to export from your browser and import into your wallabag interface.</p>

<h2>Asynchronous import will save your life (and your server!)</h2>
<p>OK, you can import thousand of articles, but your web server can't process so much data: you'll most probably end up with a timeout error if you try to import too many articles.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20import%20fail%20is%3Aclosed%20">This problem exists in wallabag for years</a>.</p>
<p>That's why we worked on a system to fetch content and import articles into wallabag asynchronously: you ask wallabag to import your articles, wallabag saves all the URLs of these articles and then, a queue system fetches content while you're using wallabag.</p>
<p>In order to use this feature, wallabag needs <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a> or <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>. The wallabag documentation explains how to configure these services.</p>
<p>Beware : these services will certainly not be available if you use shared hosting.</p>

    <h2>You can finally manage your users</h2>
    <p>You can now easily create, delete or edit an account in your wallabag instance.<br />As an administrator of wallabag, you'll have a new interface, available in the menu: <strong>Users management</strong>.</p>

    <p>This feature was claimed for months (<a href="https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues/95">on 2 August, 2013!</a>). You can now share an article publicly: by clicking on the share menu in the sidebar of the article, you can generate a public link and share it on your favorite social network!<br />Like inside your wallabag, the article is displayed in a comfortable view.</p>

<h2>One more thing...</h2>
<div style="float:right;"><img src="/images/wllbg21/android_sync.png" alt="Android Sync" /> <img src="/images/wllbg21/android_wizard.png" alt="Android Wizard" /></div>

<p>Dmitriy Bogdanov (<a href="https://github.com/di72nn">@di72nn</a>) worked really hard on the Android app and came out with the following new features :</p>
<h3>A background service</h3>
<p>It handles offline actions, like saving an article offline, marking an article as read, favoriting it or deleting it. These actions are then executed when it's possible.</p>
<h3>Automatic sync</h3>
<p>You can sync local changes and download eventual new articles on a defined schedule. Local changes can also be synched as soon as the network is available. Finally, it's possible to download an article you just added.</p>
<h3>A new connection wizard</h3>
<p>It helps you connecting to your wallabag instance. Just choose your instance or define its address, put it your credentials, and the wizard will automatically fetch connection informations.</p>
<h3>Notifications !</h3>
<p>You get notifications when the app is syncing, and when an error occurs.</p>
<h3>A proper preferences screen</h3>
<p>We got rid of the old ugly screen. Every option is saved when you change it.</p>
