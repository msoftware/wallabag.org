<p>What we need from that client is two strings: Client ID and Client secret.</p>
<p><img alt="Client" src="/images/wallabagger/opt-client.png" /></p>
<h4>Access options page</h4>

</ul>
<p><img alt="extensions" src="/images/wallabagger/opt-ext-optlink.png" /></p>
<h4>Setup process</h4>
<ul>
<li>Enter the URL of your wallabag installation (without "http://" ), check "https" if you use that, and click "Check URL" button</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="URL" src="/images/wallabagger/opt-url.png" /></p>
<p>if the URL is valid then in checklist in the bottom of page will be information about that.</p>

<ul>
<li>If the URL was checked and a correct api is found, then the client and user credential fields appears. Fill them and click the "Get token" button. From now access token will be fetched authomatically, when it expires.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Client fields" src="/images/wallabagger/opt-clientfields.png" /></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>if the credentials are correct you&#39;ll see it in the checklist with an information about that.
</pre></div>


<p><img alt="Token granted" src="/images/wallabagger/opt-granted.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>If you have tags including spaces, check appropriate options. This will toggle the ending tag key from Space to Enter</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Space in tags" src="/images/wallabagger/opt-spaceintags.png" /></p>
<h4>Security warning</h4>
<p>In this version of the extension your password is stored in the browser local storage as a plain text and could be retrieved by anyone with access to your computer. The password encryption will be implemented in future versions.</p>

If something goes wrong, an error message appears:</p>
